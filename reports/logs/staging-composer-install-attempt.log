Installing dependencies from lock file (including require-dev)
Verifying lock file contents can be installed on current platform.
Your lock file does not contain a compatible set of packages. Please run composer update.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires php >=8.0 <=8.2.30 but your php version (8.2.31-dev) does not satisfy that requirement.
